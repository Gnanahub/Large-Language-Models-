## **Exciting Announcement**: 
# LangChain Project with Google Palm and Python 
We're thrilled to unveil our latest venture leveraging the LangChain framework in collaboration with Google Palm and Python. 
This project utilizes the LangChain framework to build an advanced question-and-answer (Q&A) system specifically designed for Sourcegraph's needs.

Imagine the efficiency boost â€“ an automated system that answers questions quickly and accurately, streamlining Sourcegraph's Q&A processes. 
This project demonstrates the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to revolutionize workflows. 
We'll keep you updated as we develop a seamless Q&A experience for Sourcegraph and potentially beyond.
